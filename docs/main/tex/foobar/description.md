# FooBar

Write a program using $\LaTeX$ with the specified functionality.

Print numbers between `1` and `n` replacing some of them as follows:

- multiples of 3 - with *Foo*
- multiples of 5 - with *Bar*
- multiples of 3 and 5 - with *FooBar*

Calculate and print sum of all numbers (i.e. those not replaced).
Checksum must be printed **before** the list of numbers and replacements.

## Code organization

File *foobar.tex* contains the starting template.
You should be able to compile it and generate a valid PDF file (*foobar.pdf*).
Changing the value of `thenumber` must result in a different output.

## Constraint

Do not use any packages.

There are many excellent packages (e.g. *ifthen*, *calc*, *tikz*) that extend $\LaTeX$ functionality with loops, math operations (including modulo) etc.
You are free to explore the source of those packages to see how those operations are implemented.

Your goal is to transfer your programming knowledge and skills between languages.
